Github Commands - on our local computer
1. git init -> initialize local repository (directory) as a git respository
(prepare local repository to be attached to the one on Github)
2. paste the line you copied from Github
3. git remote -v -> to check if your local repository is connected with github
(you should see something like: origin github.com/your-username/repository name.git)
4. git add - > add all files from the repository to the staging phase
3. git commit -m"some message goes here"
4. git push origin master -> sends the files to the corresponding repository on Github
